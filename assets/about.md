pastenot.es
-----------
pastenot.es is a pastebin web-service powered by isomorphic JavaScript
and is intended to be _an objectively better pastebin web-service_.

When I started writing this project:

	I wanted it to be the very best, like no pastebin ever was.
	To edit text is it's real task, to share it is it's cause.
	It will travel across the web, searching far and wide.
	Each line of text to understand, the power that's inside.

# Note
This project is currently in alpha status and comes with all implications of such, including but not limited to:

* Even though my code is perfectly written, there may possibly be bugs somewhere?
* If anything breaks, it's by design and definitely not an issue with my code.
* Features and functionality can and likely will change on a whim.
* __ALL__ pastes __WILL__ be removed upon initial release.

tl;dr :: This is an "alpha preview". Things may break or change. Pastes will be deleted upon initial release.

### Duration
------------
Pastes will be kept for 30 days from the last view but may be removed earlier without notice.
I am not responsible for any loss of data and if you have any issues with that #dealwithit.

### Issues
----------
If you somehow encounter any bugs with this project, first ask yourself:

    "How can these bugs be real if our eyes aren't real?"
